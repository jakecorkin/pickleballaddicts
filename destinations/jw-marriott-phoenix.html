                <p>The JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge holds a distinction no other resort in America can claim: <strong>17 dedicated pickleball courts</strong> - the most at any single resort facility in the United States. This isn't just a hotel with a few courts added as an afterthought. This is a championship-level pickleball destination wrapped in a 950-acre luxury desert oasis.</p>

                <p>Set against the dramatic backdrop of the Sonoran Desert with views of the McDowell Mountains, this AAA Four-Diamond resort delivers a complete pickleball experience. From sunrise matches on pristine courts to sunset by the pool to world-class spa treatments, every detail is designed for guests who expect excellence both on and off the court.</p>

                <h2>About the Resort & Facilities</h2>
                <p>The JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge has invested heavily in becoming the premier resort destination for pickleball enthusiasts. The 17 courts represent a level of commitment to the sport that's unmatched in the hospitality industry. These aren't repurposed tennis courts - they're purpose-built pickleball facilities with proper dimensions, premium surfaces, and thoughtful amenities.</p>

                <p>The courts are spread across the expansive resort property, offering different environments for play. Some feature mountain views that will make you pause between serves. Others are strategically positioned near refreshment stations and shaded spectator areas. All courts are meticulously maintained with high-quality surfaces that provide consistent bounce and comfortable play.</p>

                <p>The resort's Racquet Club serves as pickleball central, featuring a well-stocked pro shop with equipment, apparel, and accessories. Professional instruction is available for all skill levels, from absolute beginners to competitive players looking to refine their game. The staff can arrange round-robins, competitive matches, or social play sessions to match your preferences.</p>

                <h2>What Makes This Resort Special</h2>
                <p><strong>Unmatched Court Quantity:</strong> Seventeen courts means you'll never wait for available court time. Whether you arrive for sunrise play or afternoon sessions, you'll have space. This also makes it ideal for groups - bring friends or family and everyone plays simultaneously.</p>

                <p><strong>Complete Resort Experience:</strong> After your morning matches, the day unfolds with endless options. Five pools including a zero-entry family pool and adults-only pool. The 27,000-square-foot Revive Spa offers post-match recovery with massages, body treatments, and hydrotherapy. Two championship golf courses (36 holes total) provide variety for non-pickleball days or afternoons.</p>

                <p><strong>Desert Setting & Climate:</strong> Phoenix offers more than 300 days of sunshine annually, making this a year-round destination. Fall through spring delivers ideal playing conditions with temperatures in the 70s-80s. The desert landscape provides stunning natural beauty - cactus gardens, mountain views, and spectacular sunsets frame your pickleball experience.</p>

                <p><strong>Culinary Excellence:</strong> Seven on-site dining options range from casual poolside to fine dining. Notable venues include LUSTRE Rooftop Garden for seasonal cuisine with panoramic views, Jade Court Asian Café, and the Adobe Restaurant showcasing Southwestern flavors. You'll never need to leave the property for an exceptional meal.</p>

                <h2>Planning Your Visit</h2>

                <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                <p><strong>Prime Season (October - April):</strong> Perfect weather with daytime highs in the 70s-80s and cool evenings. This is ideal for all-day outdoor activities. Peak demand means booking early is essential, especially around holidays and major events.</p>

                <p><strong>Value Season (May - September):</strong> Hot summer temperatures (95-110°F) bring significantly lower rates. Early morning and evening play remains comfortable, and the resort's pools become essential. Many regular visitors time trips for May or September to capture better weather at off-season prices.</p>

                <h3>Getting There</h3>
                <p>Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX) is 23 miles from the resort, approximately 30-40 minutes by car. The airport serves all major carriers with direct flights from most U.S. cities. Ride-sharing services are readily available, or the resort can arrange car service. A rental car provides flexibility for exploring Scottsdale, hiking trails, and other Phoenix attractions, though the resort itself offers everything you need for an exceptional stay.</p>

                <h3>What to Expect</h3>
                <p>The JW Marriott Phoenix Desert Ridge is a large resort property with 950 acres and multiple accommodation wings. Rooms are spacious with Southwestern-inspired decor, private balconies, and modern amenities. Request accommodations near the Racquet Club for easy access to courts.</p>

                <p>Court reservations are recommended, especially during peak season, though with 17 courts, availability is rarely an issue. The pro shop offers equipment rental if you prefer not to travel with paddles. Dress code is standard athletic wear.</p>

                <h3>Other Activities</h3>
                <p>Beyond pickleball, the resort offers extensive recreation: two championship golf courses designed by Arnold Palmer, five pools with cabanas and poolside service, the 27,000-square-foot Revive Spa with 25 treatment rooms, fitness center and group classes, hiking trails throughout the 950-acre property, and kids' programs through the Roadrunner Activity Club.</p>

                <p>The resort is also well-positioned for exploring the greater Phoenix and Scottsdale area, including Old Town Scottsdale galleries and shopping, Desert Botanical Garden, McDowell Sonoran Preserve hiking, and numerous additional golf courses.</p>
