                <h2>What Makes Naples Special</h2>
                <p><strong>The Official Pickleball Capital:</strong> Naples didn't just claim this title - it earned it through investment, community support, and dedication to the sport. The city has continuously expanded facilities and hosts some of the sport's most prestigious events.</p>

                <p><strong>Year-Round Perfect Weather:</strong> While much of the country deals with snow and cold, Naples offers sunshine and 70-80°F temperatures throughout fall, winter, and spring. Even summer months, though warmer, feature morning and evening play windows with spectacular Gulf Coast sunsets.</p>

                <p><strong>Beyond the Courts:</strong> After your morning match, you're minutes from world-class beaches, championship golf courses, fine dining on Fifth Avenue South, and cultural attractions like the Naples Philharmonic and Baker Museum. This is a complete vacation destination where pickleball enhances rather than defines your entire trip.</p>

                <p><strong>Tournament Central:</strong> From the US Open Pickleball Championships (held nearby in East Naples) to regional events throughout the season, Naples serves as a hub for competitive play. Even if you're not competing, watching top-level matches provides entertainment and learning opportunities.</p>

                <h2>Planning Your Visit</h2>

                <h3>Best Time to Visit</h3>
                <p><strong>Peak Season (November - April):</strong> Perfect weather with temperatures in the 70s-80s and low humidity. This is prime pickleball season with maximum tournament activity. Book accommodations well in advance as this is also peak tourist season for beaches and outdoor activities.</p>

                <p><strong>Shoulder Season (October & May):</strong> Excellent value with fewer crowds, still-great weather, and more available court time at public facilities. Many regular visitors prefer these months for the relaxed atmosphere.</p>

                <p><strong>Summer (June - September):</strong> Hot and humid, but the lowest prices of the year. Early morning and evening play is still enjoyable, and many facilities offer indoor air-conditioned courts. Great for budget-conscious travelers who don't mind the heat.</p>

                <h3>Getting There</h3>
                <p>Southwest Florida International Airport (RSW) in Fort Myers is the primary gateway, located about 45 minutes north of Naples. Major airlines offer direct flights from most U.S. cities. Alternatively, Miami International Airport is a 2-hour drive with more flight options. A rental car is recommended for exploring Naples and accessing various court locations, though some resorts offer shuttle services.</p>
